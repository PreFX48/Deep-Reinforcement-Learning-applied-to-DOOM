This is the final project for the Reinforcement Learning Course of the 2018/2019 MVA Master class.

This project, done by [Mehdi Boubnan](https://github.com/Swirler) & [Ayman Chaouki](https://github.com/chaoukia), consists on applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to learn an agent play different scenarios of the game DOOM.

We implemented value based methods such as DQN, DRQN, DDQN, and DDDQN with prioritized experience replay, and hybrid algorithms such as A3C and Curiosity.

You can see our agent playing deadly corridor scenario below after training with an A3C algorithm :
